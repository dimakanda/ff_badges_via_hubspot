This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.


## Installation ##

1. Add gem to the gemfile 

    `gem 'ff_badges', git: 'git@bitbucket.org:firefield/ff_badges.git'`

2. Copy migrations `rake railties:install:migrations` and migrate
3. Include the users concern in your user model `include FfBadges::UserConcern` and in your ApplicationController `include Concerns::FfBadges::ShowEarnedBadges`
4. Define a `badgeable_users` scope in your user model. For example: 

    `scope :badgeable_users, -> { where.not confirmed_at: nil }`

5. Add /extras folder to the loaded paths in your application.rb:
   `config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root}/lib #{config.root}/extras)`
6. FFBadges require redis server. You need to start it, usually with: `redis-server`

### Badge earned modals ###
1. Add `include Concerns::FfBadges::ShowEarnedBadges` to your `application_controller.rb`
2. Add `//= require ff_badges` to your application.js
3. Call `<%= notice_earned_badges %>` within the application template or any other that you want to use.
4. You can create a partial at `extras/ff_badges/views/modal.html.erb` which will be used as a modal when user earns a badge. Default partial will be used otherwise.


### Specs helpers ###
You want to test your badges well, that's why you should add the following to your spec_helper.rb:

       include FfBadges::SpecHelpers

Thanks to this you can use: `badge_check_modal`, `badge_check_email` and `badge_check_page_content`.


## Generators ##
